# cron & crontab: How to Use Them Effectively

*Note: This "recipe" is a merger of two older (now retired) recipes, and motivated by a desire to reduce the [sprawl](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sprawl) of this RPi repo.* 

If you're interested, you can read about the [history of `cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#History) in this Wikipedia article. Perhaps the best-known of the [modern versions of `cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Modern_versions) is Paul Vixie's implementation which first appeared in 1987; aka *Vixie cron*. This is the [version of `cron` used in Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/cron), and the sole focus of this recipe.

Those getting started with `cron` may be wondering what exactly is meant by the terms `cron` and `crontab`. A bit of explanation is in order: 

* `cron` is the name given to the *daemon* or server that runs silently behind the scenes, and does all the "real work"; ref `man cron` on your system 
* `crontab` is the "`cron` `tab`le" - literally a timetable; it provides the primary interface between the user and `cron` the daemon; ref `man crontab` on your system

Let's get started; we'll begin with the **single most frequently asked question**:



## #1 `cron` FAQ: Why does my crontab not work?

### Answer: `cron` is simple in some respects, but enigmatic in others.

I would say that there are three (3) primary factors that confuse users:

#### Factor #1: the "environment" is different.

*In Linux, ["the environment"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-environment.htm) is defined by a collection of variables. When you run a "job" (a command or a script) under `cron` your job will run in a **different** **environment** than it does when you run it from (for example) your interactive shell (e.g. `bash`).* This is important - read it again!  

***Remedies & Solutions:***

- `PATH` is an environment variable; in `cron` `PATH` is typically limited to: `/usr/bin:/bin` - that's it - two folders! Therefore, it's good practice to use absolute path statements everywhere: `$HOME/scriptname.sh` instead of `scriptname.sh` or `./scriptname.sh` or `~/scriptname.sh`. 

- You can add environment variables to the `cron` user's environment in `crontab` - [see this Q&A for how-to](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10657111/22595851).  And there are many other answers on SE (e.g. [1](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27289/how-can-i-run-a-cron-command-with-existing-environmental-variables), [2](https://serverfault.com/questions/337631/crontab-execution-doesnt-have-the-same-environment-variables-as-executing-user), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2135478/how-to-simulate-the-environment-cron-executes-a-script-with)), but many of these are misguided - or flat-out *wrong*. My best advice is to proceed with caution, and test extensively before you deploy a solution. 

- The following I consider a [silver bullet](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/silver%20bullet) solution to the problem of **environment**. It uses the `-l, --login` option of `su` to import any user's (effectively) complete environment. This can be done  without resort to the authentication requirement that usually  accompanies `su` - **if** it is run from the `root crontab`. As an example here, we start `mpg123` - a sound player that may be used with Bluetooth speakers. It is running with `pipewire` (*which may be partly responsible for the **environment***). 

  **Example:** 

  - ```bash
    $ sudo crontab -e
    ... (in editor, add one line:) ...
    
    @reboot su pi -l -c /home/pi/start-mpg123.sh > /home/pi/start-mpg123.log 2>&1 
    
    ... (where 'start-mpg123.sh' is a simple script:) 
    
    $ cat ~/start-mpg123.sh
    #!/usr/bin/bash
    sleep 5
    if [ "$(/usr/bin/bluetoothctl devices Connected)" != "Device DF:45:E9:00:BE:8B OontZ Angle solo DS E8B" ]; then
        /usr/bin/bluetoothctl connect DF:45:E9:00:BE:8B
    fi
    /usr/bin/mpg123 --loop -1 /home/pi/rainstorm.mp3
    ```


- If you've been paying attention, you should now be asking, *"But how do I know what the environment is in `cron`?"*. That's a great question! - and there's a great answer: *"Ask `cron` to tell you what its environment is!"*...  [here's how to ask](#what-is-the-cron-environment). 

#### Factor #2: `cron` has no awareness of the state of other system services.

This is typically only an issue when using the `@reboot` scheduling facility in `cron/crontab`. As an example, consider a `cron` job that requires network services, and is scheduled `@reboot`. Those required network services *may or may not* have been started by `systemd` when `cron` starts, and so attempts to run its *network-dependent* `@reboot` job(s) *may or may not* be successful. 

By necessity, `cron` considers `@reboot` to be the point in time at which `cron` itself has been started by `systemd`.  Further, as `cron` has no insight into `systemd's` machinations, it cannot possibly know the status of other services at its start time.  Consequently - *before all the system's other services are available*, there will be some risk that an `@reboot` job will fail. 

FWIW: I asked a [Question on SE a few years ago, effectively "how to force `systemd` to make `cron` the final service started"](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/680581/286615), but didn't get a useful answer. That this should be so difficult (impossible??) seems very weird to me; i.e. a software as complex as `systemd` has no concept of [ordinal numbers](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/ordinal-numbers/)... what were they thinking?     

***Remedies & Solutions:*** 

- `sleep` before starting a script with service dependencies: 

   ```bash
   @reboot ( /usr/bin/sleep 30; /bin/bash /home/pi/startup.sh ) >> $MYLOGFILE 2>&1
   ```

* write your program/script to check availability of required resources 
* `cron` itself is a service, and yes - it may be managed under `systemd`! 

   The service file for `cron` is found in `/lib/systemd/system/cron.service`.  You may modify this file to add dependencies. For example: If many of your `cron` jobs require an active, operational network service be available, you may wish to [add the following](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/NetworkTarget/) to the `[Unit]` section your `cron.service` file:
   ```
   After=network-online.target
   ```

#### Factor #3: `cron` output goes to `/dev/null`

Users sometimes wonder why they don't see any output at the terminal from their `cron` jobs - as they did when they ran the same program from their interactive shell (e.g. `bash`). 

***Remedies & Solutions:*** 

* `redirect (>, >>)` the output of your `cron` job to capture `stderr` & `stdout` in a file:

   ```bash
   @reboot ( /bin/sleep 30; /bin/bash /home/pi/startup.sh > /home/pi/cronjoblog 2>&1)
   ```

* enable logging for `cron`

   Edit the file `/etc/rsyslog.conf` to remove the comment (#) from `#cron`: 

   ```bash
   FROM:  #cron.*                         /var/log/cron.log  
   
   TO:     cron.*                         /var/log/cron.log
   ```

* use the `MAILTO` variable in your `crontab` 

   Assuming you have an MTA installed on your system, you may insert the `MAILTO` variable in your `crontab` to send email notifications to all your `cron` jobs - or to each one individually. See `man 5 crontab` for details, or peruse the references listed below. 
   
   If you want to install an MTA for *local* use only, the package `exim4-daemon-light` will serve that purpose : 
   
   ```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install exim4-daemon-light
   ```
   



## What is the cron environment?

We'll ask `cron` to tell us: 

#### Step 1: Open the user crontab for editing:

```bash
   $ crontab -e 
   # alternatively, open the root crontab for editing: 
   $ sudo crontab -e
```

#### Step 2: Add 1 line: 

```
   * * * * * /usr/bin/printenv > /home/yourusername/user-cronenv.txt 2>&1
   # alternatively, for the root crontab:
   * * * * * /usr/bin/printenv > /home/yourusername/root-cronenv.txt 2>&1
```

#### Step 3: Save the file, and exit the editor: 

```bash
   $ crontab -e (entered above, then editing ..., then exit editor)
   crontab: installing new crontab
   $ 
```

#### Step 4: Read cron's answer: 

```bash
   $ cd && cat user-cronenv.txt
   (here's the answer I got:)
   HOME=/home/pi
   MAILTO=
   LOGNAME=pi
   PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
   LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
   SHELL=/bin/sh
   PWD=/home/pi
```

You may repeat Steps 1-4 above for the `root crontab`. Next, you may want to try adding an environment variable to your `crontab`, and observe the change in `user-cronenv.txt`. 

If you're not familiar with your own user *environment* under your *interactive/login* shell, it may be informative to run `printenv` from the CLI, and compare it against the `cron` *environment*. You'll notice numerous differences. Having this information, knowing how the `cron` user's environment differs from yours, will help create rational `cron` jobs, and help troubleshooting when they don't behave as you'd like. Finally, you can change the *environment* for `cron`; modify it to better meet your needs. See the REFERENCES for ideas.
