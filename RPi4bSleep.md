## Minimize Raspberry Pi 4B Power Consumption After `halt`... or `shutdown`... or `poweroff` 

   N.B. If you are using - or have plans to use - the `dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff` in `/boot/config.txt`, please review the [UPDATES](#UPDATES) section at the bottom of this page before you proceed here.

### Who cares about minimizing power consumption?

For those considering the RPi 4B for a role in an *off-grid* project, a *mobile* application, or anyone else who needs to power the RPi 4B from a battery for more than a few minutes, this recipe may be of interest. Or, perhaps, anyone who simply doesn't wish to see [energy wasted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy) - that is to say converted to heat, without anything useful being accomplished in the expenditure. 

Unfortunately, no RPi has yet been been designed or produced with a [*"sleep mode"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_mode). And no RPi has been produced that complies with the  [*"One Watt Initiative"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Watt_Initiative) - which has actually been the *one-half watt initiative* since 2013! Perhaps the folk pimping Pis in the name of charitable education in Cambridge, UK are ignorant of the *"One Watt Initiative"*? With well [over 30 million RPi units manufactured and sold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Sales) to date, and volumes now in the range of 10 million units per year, an outsider may wonder why this has been ignored. It's been opined by some that the RPi does not incorporate energy saving features because they would add to the cost...?! Think on that one for a moment, but it's time to end the rant, and get on with the subject at hand. 



### Some background

This all started when I read a post made by a "Raspberry Pi Engineer" in the Raspberry Pi Organization's forum. [In this post, dated June 24, 2019](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1484347#p1484347) it was claimed: 

>"sudo poweroff" will shut down the PMIC *[Power Management Integrated Circuit - a RPi hardware component that controls power distribution]* at the  conclusion of the shutdown sequence. This reduces power consumption to  about 3mA but requires pulling GLOBAL_EN low (or cycling input power) to wake the PMIC up.
>
>There's user-modifiable EEPROM setting to change this behaviour (halt  instead of poweroff, allows GPIO pin wake) but these are currently  deliberately undocumented until we have a reliable, scripted way to  change these.

More than two years and several firmware revisions later, this claim remains unrealized, although giving full credit, it seems there have been some improvements. Following are the results of measurements made on my RPi 4B since this *recipe* was initially published: 

* While up and running: 

  * The Apr 29 2021 version of the bootloader: approx 2.0 Watts; 400mA  
  * The Jun 15, 2020 version of the bootloader: approx 2.5 Watts; 500mA  

* Following `shutdown`, `halt` or `poweroff` with **default** bootloader configuration: 

  * The Apr 29 2021 version of the bootloader: approx 1.35 Watts; 270mA
  * The Jun 15, 2020 version of the bootloader: approx 1.85 Watts; 370mA

* Following `shutdown`, `halt` or `poweroff` with **Low Power Mode** bootloader configuration: 

  * Tue Jan 25  2022 version of the bootloader: approx 0.2 Watts; 40mA
  * The Apr 29 2021 version of the bootloader: approx 0.15 Watts; 35mA
  * The Jun 15, 2020 version of the bootloader: approx 0.2 Watts; 40mA
  
  <sub>NOTE 1: `buster`OS, `Lite`Â distro for RPi, no monitor, quiescent/idle compute load, CPU governor: `ondemand`</sub> 
  
  <sub>NOTE 2: No differences in power consumption noted between `halt`, `shutdown` `poweroff`</sub> 



### What is "Low Power Mode" (LPM) - Is it a "Sleep Mode"?

**No...** **the Raspberry Pi has no [Sleep mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_mode)**; it does not have a complete set of any of the states considered to constitute "Sleep mode". It only has the ability to reduce its power consumption following a `halt`, `shutdown`, or `poweroff` command. Consequently, "Low Power Mode" (LPM) is simply a state of **reduced power consumption** after all processing has been terminated - it does not save state, and offers no way to *restore* or *resume* processing. Restoring the RPi to an operational mode may only be accomplished by a `reboot`.  A `reboot` is triggered by removing and re-installing power (*"pulling the plug"*), or by using an external switch to trigger a `reboot`; for example the `RUN` or `GLOBAL_EN` terminals on the board. 



### How to configure LPM for the RPi 4B:

The RPi 4B represents a break from previous models in that bootloader code is stored in EEPROM - the boot code is now resident in the hardware instead of in the `/boot/bootcode.bin` file on the SD card. With this change came a new set of configuration parameters, and new software tools to assist managing the bootloader. Most of the "official documentation" on the EEPROM-based bootloader is in two locations:

* [Raspberry Pi 4 boot EEPROM](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#rpi-eeprom-update) - covers administration of the bootloader code in EEPROM
* [Raspberry Pi 4 bootloader configuration](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-configuration) - an explanation of the configuration parameters

The *"Low Power Mode (**LPM**)"* is not the *default* bootloader configuration. However, reviewing the referenced documents above tells us what we need know to re-configure the system. As you see below, making this configuration change is very simple now: 

<sup>*NOTE: Review the "official" documentation to confirm these instructions remain valid*.</sup> 

##### 1. Open the bootloader configuration file for editing:

      ```bash
      $ sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit 
      [all]
      BOOT_UART=0
      WAKE_ON_GPIO=1
      POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0
      DHCP_TIMEOUT=45000
      DHCP_REQ_TIMEOUT=4000
      TFTP_FILE_TIMEOUT=30000
      ENABLE_SELF_UPDATE=1
      DISABLE_HDMI=0
      BOOT_ORDER=0xf41
      ```

##### 2. Change two (2) parameters (`WAKE_ON_GPIO` and `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT`) in the editor as follows:

      ```bash
      # WAKE_ON_GPIO:       CHANGE FROM: 1  TO: 0
      # POWER_OFF_ON_HALT:  CHANGE FROM: 0  TO: 1
      ```

##### 3. Save changes & re-boot

      ```bash
      # Save the changes, and exit the editor. 
      # After the editor closes, you'll be prompted to reboot into the new configuration
      
      $ sudo reboot
      ```

Configured in this way, you will see a marked reduction in power consumption (and current draw) the next time you issue a `halt`, `shutdown`, or `poweroff` command - or shut down your system using the desktop. 

##### 4. Test the change:

The EEPROM firmware has now been modified, and the system has booted with the modified firmware. How did these modifications affect power consumption? See the *measured* results in the table below:

> NOTE: All measurements made with Ethernet cable connecting RPi 4 to Ethernet Switch. 

| BEFORE BOOTLOADER MODIFICATION                               | AFTER BOOTLOADER MODIFICATION                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `critical/pieeprom-2020-04-16.bin`                           | `stable/pieeprom-2020-06-15.bin`                             |
| `WAKE_ON_GPIO=1`                                             | `WAKE_ON_GPIO=0`                                             |
| `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0`                                        | `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1`                                        |
| Measured current while running: 0.51A                        | Measured current while running: 0.50A                        |
| ![](pix/run-510mA.jpeg) | ![](pix/run-500mA.jpeg) |
| Measured current after `halt`/`poweroff`: 0.37A              | Measured current after `halt`/`poweroff`: 0.04A              |
| ![](pix/halt-370mA.jpeg) | ![](pix/halt-40mA.jpeg) |

##### 5. Summary

That's a 90% reduction in power consumption in `halt`/`poweroff` mode. It's certainly an improvement, but given the initial claim, a bit disappointing. Not only is the power consumption in "Low Power Mode" an [order of magnitude greater than claimed by "Raspberry Pi Engineer"](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1484347#p1484347), it's not low enough to permit battery-powered operation in many remote-sensor applications.  



### Is there a *downside* to LPM?

If you are using the [*"One Button Startup/Shutdown"*](https://www.stderr.nl/Blog/Hardware/RaspberryPi/PowerButton.html#comments) feature enabled by the `gpio-shutdown` `dtoverlay` [REF](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README), you will find this no longer works. As [The Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation) currently has things jiggered, the only way (other than *"pulling the plug"*) to reboot the RPi is to pull down & release the `GLOBAL_EN` node (see figure below). For now, this will require adding a separate switch/button tied to `GLOBAL_EN`, or some additional hardware - [as in this example](https://github.com/seamusdemora/PiFormulae/blob/master/LoPwrOneButtonStartStop.md).

## UPDATES:

**2021/04/24:** For reasons that are [not _entirely clear_](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/issues/330), the "low power configuration" outlined here cannot be used with the `dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff` in `/boot/config.txt`. IOW: **You may use** the "low power configuration" described here, _**OR**_ the gpio-poweroff overlay **BUT NOT BOTH**.

**2021/04/30:** This seems to be [resolved now](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/issues/330#issuecomment-827417475). It was classified by the RPi maintainers as **not a bug**, but eventually the team made some changes in the `gpio-poweroff` kernel code to remediate the issue. I've not gotten around to testing the it yet. Will post again when I have. 


<!--- 

You can hide shit in here  :)   LOL 

***MUCH OF THE FOLLOWING WAS RENDERED OBSOLETE FOLLOWING UPDATES TO THE `rpi-eeprom-update` UTILITY. IT'S LEFT HERE AS SOME OF IT MAY BE USEFUL IN FUTURE UPDATES TO THIS RECIPE.*** 


 `sudo poweroff` results in a current drain of approximately 270mA on my RPi 4b. That's just under 1.5 Watts - enough to make a Raspberry Pi 4B a nice hand-warmer on a frosty day. Also, power consumption is unchanged between `poweroff`, `halt` and `shutdown`. ***What happened?!*** 

During a [SE Q&A](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/114092/does-raspberry-pi-4-consume-considerable-amount-of-power-in-soft-off-state) I became aware of this addition to the Raspberry Pi documentation: [Pi 4 Bootloader Configuration](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711_bootloader_config.md). Their documentation implies that changing certain bootloader EEPROM values will disable the PMIC after a `halt` command, resulting in the *"lowest possible power state"*. That seems a curious choice of words, and a rather *"slippery" bit of specsmanship*. We'll try to do better than that in the sequel below. 

### Why does this work only on RPi 4?

The RPi 4B represents a break from previous models in that boot code is stored in EEPROM on the board. The boot code for Raspberry Pi 4 is now resident in the hardware - instead of in the `bootcode.bin` file on the SD card - as it is for all previous models of the Raspberry Pi. This page in *"The Organization's"* documentation on the [Raspberry Pi 4 boot EEPROM](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md) explains the motivation for this change. This change also prompts us to consider the possibility of error during EEPROM modification, and to have a [recovery plan](#recovery-plan) **before** an error occurs. 

### Make the change:

***But first...*** You should review "The Organization's" documentation on [Pi 4 Bootloader Configuration](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711_bootloader_config.md), and these [details on EEPROM configuration](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md) before proceeding here, if only to confirm these instructions are still valid. You may also consult `man rpi-eeprom-config`, thought it's fairly sparse. N.B. Storing the RPi bootcode in EEPROM is a *"new era"* for Raspberry Pi, and there may be changes that supersede these procedures. As you'll see, changing the boot configuration is not complicated, but improving one's forward visibility is always prudent. 

#### 1. Show the current EEPROM bootloader configuration: 

  ```bash
$ vcgencmd bootloader_config
BOOT_UART=0
WAKE_ON_GPIO=1
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0
FREEZE_VERSION=0  
  ```

***ALTERNATIVELY:***

```bash
$ rpi-eeprom-config
[all]
BOOT_UART=0
WAKE_ON_GPIO=0
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1
DHCP_TIMEOUT=45000
DHCP_REQ_TIMEOUT=4000
TFTP_FILE_TIMEOUT=30000
ENABLE_SELF_UPDATE=1
DISABLE_HDMI=0
BOOT_ORDER=0xf41
```



***NOTE:*** `vcgencmd bootloader_config` **MAY NOT** list all the editable config variables - depending upon which version you are using. The EEPROM firmware (boot code) and associated tools are very much in a state of flux as of this writing, and the configuration variables may have changed.

The values of interest here are: `WAKE_ON_GPIO` and `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT`. Disabling the PMIC in `halt` mode requires these values be set as follows: 

  * **WAKE_ON_GPIO=0** 
  * **POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1** 

#### 2. Edit the EEPROM bootloader configuration:

Raspberry Pi 4 has some new tools for managing the bootloader configuration: `rpi-eeprom-config` and `rpi-eeprom-update`. The first one we'll use is `rpi-eeprom-config` - see the `man` pages for details. Here's the procedure to follow:

##### 2.1 make a local copy of the current EEPROM bootloader firmware file:

 `man rpi-eeprom-update` tells us our EEPROM firmware files are located in `/lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader` and its sub-folders. The subfolders indicate the *release status* of the files within: 
  >  >**Release status:**
  >  >
  >  >**critical / *default***: The latest production release plus important security or hardware compatibility bug fixes.
  >  >
  >  >**stable / *latest***:  Contains new features that have already undergone some beta testing.  These are candidates for new production releases.
  >  >
  >  >**beta**: New features, bug fixes for development/test purposes. Use at your own risk!

   After some *rummaging*, I elected to use the 2020-06-15 version from `stable`, rather than the 2020-04-16 version from `critical` 

```bash
$ cp /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/stable/pieeprom-2020-06-15.bin ./pieeprom.bin

# we now have a copy of the bootloader firmware in the `pwd` named `pieeprom.bin`
```

##### 2.2 extract configuration variables from local copy of bootloader firmware file:

Use the tool `rpi-eeprom-config` to extract the configuration variables to a text file:

  ```bash
$ rpi-eeprom-config pieeprom.bin > boot_lowpwr.txt
  ```

##### 2.3 edit the text file conatining the configuration variables 

```bash
$ nano boot_lowpwr.txt

# set WAKE_ON_GPIO=0 
# set POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1
```

save the changes, exit `nano` 

##### 2.4 revise the local copy of bootloader firmware file with the revised configuration file

Use the tool `rpi-eeprom-config` to create a revised bootloader firmware file using the revised configuration:

 ***pieeprom.bin + boot_lowpwr.txt  â  pieeprom-lopwr.bin***

*accomplished as follows:*

```bash
$ rpi-eeprom-config --out pieeprom-lopwr.bin --config boot_lowpwr.txt pieeprom.bin
```

#### 3. Flash the EEPROM with the revised bootloader firmware file:

Use the tool `rpi-eeprom-update` to flash the EEPROM with the revised configuration:

  ```bash
$ sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -f ./pieeprom-lopwr.bin
BCM2711 detected
Dedicated VL805 EEPROM detected
BOOTFS /boot
*** INSTALLING ./pieeprom-lopwr.bin  ***
BOOTFS /boot
EEPROM update pending. Please reboot to apply the update.
$ sudo reboot
  ```

The `reboot` should load the modified values into the bootloader EEPROM.

#### 4. Test the change:

The EEPROM firmware has now been modified, and the system has booted with this modified firmware: 

* from `critical/pieeprom-2020-04-16.bin` to `stable/pieeprom-2020-06-15.bin` 

* values of `WAKE_ON_GPIO` and `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT` have been modified to minimize power consumption in `halt`

If the system failed to `reboot`, execute the [Recovery Plan](#recovery-plan) & repeat the steps above after determination of the mis-step. 

How did these modifications affect power consumption? See the results in the table below:

> NOTE: All measurements made with Ethernet cable connecting RPi 4 to Ethernet Switch. 

| BEFORE BOOTLOADER MODIFICATION                               | AFTER BOOTLOADER MODIFICATION                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `critical/pieeprom-2020-04-16.bin`                           | `stable/pieeprom-2020-06-15.bin`                             |
| `WAKE_ON_GPIO=1`                                             | `WAKE_ON_GPIO=0`                                             |
| `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0`                                        | `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1`                                        |
| Measured current while running: 0.51A                        | Measured current while running: 0.50A                        |
| ![](pix/run-510mA.jpeg) | ![](pix/run-500mA.jpeg) |
| Measured current after `halt`/`poweroff`: 0.37A              | Measured current after `halt`/`poweroff`: 0.04A              |
| ![](pix/halt-370mA.jpeg) | ![](pix/halt-40mA.jpeg) |

#### 5. Summary 

That's a 90% reduction in power consumption in `halt`/`poweroff` mode. It's certainly an improvement, but given the initial claim, it is also disappointing! Not only is it an [order of magnitude greater than claimed by "Raspberry Pi Engineer"](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1484347#p1484347), it's not low enough to permit battery-powered operation in many remote-sensor applications. ***The claim was misleading***. 

#### 6. Revert to original firmware - OPTION

If you wish to restore your original EEPROM bootloader configuration: 

```bash
$ sudo rpi-eeprom-update -d -f /lib/firmware/raspberrypi/bootloader/critical/pieeprom-2020-04-16.bin 
...
$ sudo reboot
```





### Recovery Plan

In the event something goes wrong, let's marshal the resources needed for recovery of the boot EEPROM before making any changes to the existing configuration :

* [Instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/booteeprom.md) in the `Recovery image` section state: 

  >If the Raspberry Pi is not booting it's possible that the bootloader  EEPROM is corrupted. This can easily be reprogrammed using the Raspberry Pi Imager tool which is available via the [raspberrypi.org downloads page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). 
  >
  > Using the recovery image will erase any custom configuration options, resetting the bootloader back to factory defaults.

* Download the `.zip` file containing the [latest production recovery image](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/blob/master/releases.md) to your workstation

* Format a micro SD card (NTE 32GB) using `FAT32` (not exFAT!... FAT32!)

* Unzip the the downloaded recovery image to a folder & copy all files in this folder to the root of the FAT32-formatted micro SD card. 

* Read the instructions in the `README` file, esp: 

    >To re-flash the EEPROM
    >
    >1. Unzip the contents of this zip file to a blank FAT formatted SD-SDCARD.
    >2. Power off the Raspberry Pi
    >3. Insert the sd-card.
    >4. Power on Raspberry Pi
    >5. Wait at least 10 seconds.
    
* Once the files are copied to the micro SD card, set it aside in the event that it is needed.

[RPi firmware update and recovery guide](https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-firmware-updating-recovery-guide/) 

the recovery tool to reflash your bootloader if something goes wrong 





For your RPi to remain warm after an hour would *"probably"* require the CPU still be running, although it could be due to the power management IC. These seem to be the hottest components, based on [this study](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-4-firmware-update-tested,39791.html):

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

Keep in mind this image is an *operating* RPi 4B - i.e. not in `shutdown` mode. 

There are a couple of things to know as "background" to your question: 

1. RPi is not an open system. Yes, some of the circuitry is documented, but some is not. The firmware is closed-source. This makes definitive answers to questions such as yours difficult - if not impossible. 

2. At this time, there is no true "**sleep mode**" on any RPi - this has been the subject of *much* discussion over the years. I refer to **sleep mode** as an extremely low power mode (on the order of a milliamp or less) from which it is possible to awake and resume operations ([as defined here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_mode)). 

I have a true *headless* RPi 4B - that is to say that the "Lite" version of Raspbian is installed, and is incapable of running in *GUI* mode. The shutdown button you describe in your question may be different than `sudo shutdown` that I enter from the command line... this would surprise me, but it *could be*. 

I attempted to replicate your result, except I left the ethernet cable plugged in. I entered `sudo shutdown`, and when my SSH connection was interrupted, I started a timer on my phone. The ethernet status lights continued to flicker, and the "red light" was on the entire time. On my headless RPi 4B, one hour after running `sudo shutdown`, I can not detect anything that feels warmer than ambient. 

There's an [interesting thread](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1484347#p1484330) in the RPi.org forum on "sleep mode" for the Raspberry Pi 4B. Synopsized below are some of the more interesting posts in that thread: 

* a [**RPi Engineer** claims](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1484347#p1484347): 
  * power consumption in `shutdown`<sup>Note 1</sup> is "about 3 mA" !?
  * there are *undocumented* methods for changing the current behavior


[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/C4sLZ.png

---
Note 1: The actual claim is for `poweroff`, **but** `man shutdown` tells us that `shutdown` defaults to `poweroff`; i.e. they are the same state.
